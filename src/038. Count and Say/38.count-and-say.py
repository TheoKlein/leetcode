#
# The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five
# terms as following:
# 
# 
# 1.     1
# 2.     11
# 3.     21
# 4.     1211
# 5.     111221
# 
# 
# 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
# 11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
# 21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
# 
# Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the n^th term of the
# count-and-say sequence.
# 
# Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a
# string.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: 1
# Output: "1"
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: 4
# Output: "1211"

class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        # good way to use groupby()
        s = '1'
        for i in range(n - 1):
            s = ''.join(str(len(list(group))) + digits for digits, group in itertools.groupby(s))
        return s
