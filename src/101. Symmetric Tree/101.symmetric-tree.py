# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]'
#
# Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric
# around its center).
# 
# For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:
# 
# 
# ⁠   1
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 2   2
# ⁠/ \ / \
# 3  4 4  3
# 
# 
# 
# 
# But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:
# 
# 
# ⁠   1
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 2   2
# ⁠  \   \
# ⁠  3    3
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if root is None:
            return True
        return self.recur(root.left, root.right)

    def recur(self, left, right):
        if left is None and right is None:
            return True
        if left is None or right is None:
            return False

        if left.val == right.val:
            return self.recur(left.left, right.right) and self.recur(left.right, right.left)
        return False
