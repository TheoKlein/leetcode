#
# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative
# integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes
# contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
# 
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
# number 0 itself.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
# Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
# Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

            if l2:
                n2 = l2.val
                l2 = l2.next

            carry, remain = (n1 + n2 + carry) // 10, (n1 + n2 + carry) % 10

            tmp.next = ListNode(remain)
            tmp = tmp.next
            
        return root.next
