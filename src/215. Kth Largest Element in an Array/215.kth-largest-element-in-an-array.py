#
# Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth
# largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
# Output: 5
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
# Output: 4
# 
# Note: 
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ array's length.
#

class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # min heap
        import heapq
        min_heap = [float("-inf")] * k
        heapq.heapify(min_heap)
        for n in nums:
            if n > min_heap[0]:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, n)
        return min_heap[0]
