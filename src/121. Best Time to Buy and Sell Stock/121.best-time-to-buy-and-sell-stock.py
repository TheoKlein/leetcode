# Testcase Example:  '[7,1,5,3,6,4]'
#
# Say you have an array for which the i^th element is the price of a given
# stock on day i.
# 
# If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one
# and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum
# profit.
# 
# Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit =
# 6-1 = 5.
# Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
# 
# 
#
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) == 0:
            return 0

        min_price = prices[0]
        profit = 0

        for price in prices[1:]:
            if price < min_price:
                min_price = price
            else:
                if price - min_price > profit:
                    profit = price - min_price
        return profit
